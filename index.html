            Team 12 <em>"Hour of Code"</em> event</h2>
        <p>
           <foreground>The "Hour of Code" event was a very good opportunity for us to demonstrate and evaluate our learning outcomes from code.org practice and to be able to explain them to the school children.
            We ran our event at Secondary School 238, Baku (one of our members Laman Panakhova graduated) on the 10th of November.
            We had 5th and 6th-grade students who participated in the event.
            The duration of the event was approximately 1 hour.
            Laman Panakhova and Kawthar Babili participated in the event.
            Unfortunately, because of some technical problems Asgar Huseynli and Ismayil Ismayilov - our team members could not join us.
            However, they strongly collaborated with us for completing the report and edit videos and photos.
            During the event, 22 participants learned about ADA University, Hour of Code principles, and the fundamentals of coding by exploring, playing, and creating the project.
            They worked in pairs and discussed the outcomes with each - other.
            Everyone worked on their laptops.
            We used both Azerbaijani and English for communication.
            At the end of the event, we gathered their opinions and dreams of majors for the future.
            Based on their responses we were sure that we did our job as we saw a passion from them to pursue their education in the IT and Engineering school.
            They loved and enjoyed the event as we did.
            We are very proud of our team that we could run our event successfully and represent ADA University in a high school in Azerbaijan.</foreground>
